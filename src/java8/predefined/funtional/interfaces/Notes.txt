==================================
How Lambda expression are written
==================================
A Lambda expression is written with out
    1. remove modifier
    2. remove return type
    3. remove method name

Eg: public void sum(int a, int b) { return a+b }
    Lambda expression will be (int a, int b) -> {return a+b;};


==========================================
PREDICATE, FUNCTION, CONSUMER AND SUPPLIER
==========================================

The below three functional interfaces takes only one input parameter
Predicate
Function
Consumer



The below functional interface takes zero input parameters
Supplier

The below three functional interfaces takes two input parameters
BiPredicate
BiFunction
BiConsumer

Note: If you want to have more than two input parameters then you have to write your own custom Functional Interface

Primitive Predicate Types
==========================
// Here in the above example there is autoboxing (int --> Integer) and AutoUnboxing (Integer --> int) is happening which
// is going to reduce the performance of the code, so for that reason they have introduced
// PRIMITIVE VERSION OF FUNCTIONAL INTERFACES which addresses this performance issues
// It does not do anymore autoboxing and autounboxing
// IntPredicate     --> always take int primitive type as input value
// DoublePredicate  --> always take double primitive type as input value
// LongPredicate    --> always take long primitive type as input value


Primitive Function Types
===========================
DoubleFunction  --> can take input type as double and return type can be anytype
IntFunction     --> can take input type as int and return type can be anytype
LongFunction    --> can take input type as long and return type can be anytype

DoubleToIntFunction     --> inputType is double and return type is int Eg: int applyAsInt(double value)
DoubleToLongFunction    --> inputType is double and return type is long Eg: long applyAsLong(double value)
IntToDoubleFunction
IntToLongFunction

=================================
Method and Constructor Reference
=================================
An alternate to Lambda expressions is Method and Constructor Reference
Eg: Test14Runnable.java is using lambda expression
    Test15MethodReference is method reference example

Method reference can be done on static and non-static methods
Static method       --> classname::method_name
NonStatic method    --> objectreference::method_name

* In case of method reference different return types are allowed, but only restriction arguments types must be matched

Now Constructor Reference
Classname::new ==> This is Constructor Reference
